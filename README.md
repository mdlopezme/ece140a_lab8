### Tutorial 1: Introduction to CAD

In this tutorial we used Solidworks to make the part especified in the tutorial.  
Then exported it to STL, and ended up printing it in the ECE Makerspace.

### Tutorial 3: Color Segmentation

This tutorial showed how to track an object by color. This was done by creating a mask that selects color values within a certain range, denoising, connecting adjacent masked values into objects, and selecting the largest object. Using the HSV color space allows good color tracking with good tolerance for poor lighting.
